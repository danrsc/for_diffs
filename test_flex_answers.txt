% This file contains the stimulus data used to generate a new experiment.        %
% It is tab delmited with some markup in some of the columns as explained below. %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Comments are allowed at any point in the file.
%
% The first part of the file is a header which defines the markup.
%
% After the header, each line represents an item.  The columns become fields of that item.
% Each column has a type, which can be numerical or a string, or a spaceDelimTagged type.
%
% If a column type is spaceDelimTagged, then the value in that column is first split on spaces.
% Each sub-item within the column is placed into an array, and each has its own fields which are
% determined by the header.  These fields are delimited by / (slash).
% 
% Fields can be either named or unnamed.  Unnamed fields are required for every sub-item.
% Named fields are optional.  '=' separates names from values for named tags.
% 
% The columns entry in the header specifies what the column names and types are in the order of the columns.
% 
% unnamed_field entries in the header are specified in the order in which they are expected.
% The unnamed_field entry is <column_name>:<structure_field_name>=<field_type>[:allowed values]
% column_name specifies which column the field belongs to.
% structure_field_name is the name used on the structure into which this file is parsed.
% field_type can be string or a numerical type
% You can restrict a field to draw its values from a closed set in order to ensure no typos
% occur in the this file.  In this case, follow the file_type by a ':' and a set of allowed values
% allowed values is a set of allowed values separated by commas and enclosed in curly braces.
% The closed set specifies the set of strings that are allowed in this file - it does not compare
% integer types to each other for instance
% Allowed values can also be converted from the file form if an -> is specified within the value
% e.g. a field value could be 's->sentence'.  In that case, 's' is used as the value in this file, but
% the parsed form will be 'sentence'.
% This is useful if you want a short form in the file to be parsed into a longer form for instance.
%
% named_field entries are similar to unnamed_field entries.  The order in which they are specified
% is unimportant.  There are two differences from unnamed_field entries.
% file_field_name specifies the name used to indicate that field in this file.  By default, this is
% also used as the structure_field_name, but you can use the -> operator to use a different structure_field_name.
% The other difference is that the entry must end eith the default value for the field.  sub-items which do not
% specify the named field will take the default value.
% <column_name>:<file_field_name>[->structure_field_name]=<field_type>[:allowed values];default=<defaultVal>
% sub-items which do not specify the named field will take the default value.
%
% It is possible to reference a different field's allowed values so that you don't need to create a 
% (possibly large) closed set of allowed values twice.  To reference a different field's allowed values set
% the field_type to 'use_values_from' and specify which column field name combination to use separated by a '.'.
% The column you are using the values from can be the same column as the current field but does not have to be.
% For an unnamed_field entry this would like like:
% myColumnName:myField=use_values_from:someOtherColumn.someOtherField
% 
% Finally, in addition to specifying the format for the latter part of the file, the header can include
% key value pairs that will be returned by the parser.  This can be used to add configuration that is
% defined at the experiment level rather than the item level.  The keys are always strings, the values
% can take numerical, boolean or string types.  To use a typed value, add an underscore with the type to
% the keyval specifier.  For example, to use a bool:
% keyval_bool:myBool=true
%
% The end of the header is indicated by a line with 5 stars: *****

The/tr=5 Victoria line is part of the London Underground network. It/tr=3 is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from Brixton to Walthamstow Central. It/tr=3 started running in 1968. On/tr=3 the Tube map it is shown with a light blue color. It/tr=3 is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network. It/tr=3 is one of two lines that are completely underground.	Is/tr=4 the Victoria line completely underground?	Did/tr=4 the Victoria line exist before the 1960s?	1	-1	0	-1
Timpani/tr=5 are drums that are made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper. They/tr=3 have a skin-like material stretched over the top. This/tr=3 material used to be a type of vellum or treated skin, but modern drums use a synthetic material. Someone/tr=3 who plays a timpani is called a "timpanist".	Is/tr=4 a timpani a musical instrument?	Is/tr=4 a timpani square in shape?	5	-1	5	1.5
The/tr=5 historical basis of the Iliad has been a topic of scholarly debate for centuries. While/tr=3 researchers of the 18th century considered the Trojan War as fable, the excavation of Troy VIIa has made it plausible that it was partially based on an historical conflict of the 12th century BC, even if the poems of Homer came four centuries later.	Is/tr=4 it possible that the Iliad is based on a real event?	Was/tr=4 the Iliad written in the 12th century BC?	1	-1	0	-1
In/tr=5 the American Civil War, as was typical of the 19th century, more soldiers died of disease than in battle. Conditions/tr=3 were poor in the Confederacy, where doctors and medical supplies were in short supply. The/tr=3 war had a dramatic long-term impact on American medicine, from surgical techniques to hospitals to nursing and to research facilities.	Were/tr=4 the majority of deaths in the Civil War due to disease?	Did/tr=4 the Confederacy have good medical infrastructure?	5	-1	5	1.5
A/tr=5 smart grid is a modern electrical grid that aims to distribute energy more reliably and efficiently. To/tr=3 achieve this, the smart grid first uses information and communications technology to collect information about the behaviors of its suppliers and consumers. Then,/tr=3 the smart grid automatically acts on this information by undertaking appropriate adjustments.	Does/tr=4 the smart grid aim to be more efficient than the traditional electrical grid?	Does/tr=4 the smart grid act independently of consumers?	1	-1	0	-1
The/tr=5 modern violin is about 400 years old. Similar/tr=3 string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years. By/tr=3 the time the modern orchestra started in the 17th century, the violin was fully developed. It/tr=3 is used as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music and in jazz. It/tr=3 is also used in folk music.	Can/tr=4 the violin be played without accompaniment?	Has/tr=4 the violin stayed approximately the same in the last 1000 years?	5	-1	5	1.5
An/tr=5 ornithopter is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings. An/tr=3 effective ornithopter must have wings capable of generating both thrust, the force that propels the craft forward, and lift, the force, perpendicular to the direction of flight, that keeps the craft airborne. These/tr=3 forces must be strong enough to counter the effects of drag and the weight of the craft.	Do/tr=4 the thrust and lift forces help an ornithopter fly?	Is/tr=4 an airplane a type of an ornithopter?	1	-1	0	-1
Vanilla/tr=5 is a flavor derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla, primarily from the Mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla. The/tr=3 word vanilla is derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word for "pod". Initial/tr=3 attempts to cultivate vanilla outside Mexico and Central America proved futile because of the symbiotic relationship between the vanilla orchid and its natural pollinator, the local species of Melipona bee.	Does/tr=4 vanilla come from a type of flower?	Was/tr=4 it initially easy to grow vanilla in Europe?	5	-1	5	1.5
The/tr=5 birth of each rainbow begins with millions of tiny rain droplets. White/tr=3 light enters one individual rain droplet and exits as one specific color of the spectrum. The/tr=3 colors of a rainbow are always ordered red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Without/tr=3 millions of rain droplets, you would never see a colorful rainbow.	Is/tr=4 a rainbow made of water droplets?	Can/tr=4 a rainbow be seen in the dark?	1	-1	0	-1
Oatmeal/tr=5 typically is bought in a cylindrical container and is dry before being prepared. The/tr=3 dusty oats must be measured out using a measuring cup, and then cooked with boiling water or milk. After/tr=3 cooking, oatmeal has a mushy texture and plain flavor. To/tr=3 make oatmeal sweet, brown sugar or sticky honey can be added; to make it crunchy, granola. For/tr=3 a special treat, plump raisins or melting chocolate chips will make anyone smile.	Can/tr=4 oatmeal be made by mixing oats with hot water?	Is/tr=4 cooked oatmeal dry?	5	-1	5	1.5
By/tr=5 creating three branches of government, the delegates built a "check and balance" system into the Constitution. This/tr=3 system was built so that no one branch of our government could become too powerful. Each/tr=3 branch is restrained by the other two in several ways. For/tr=3 example, the president may veto a law passed by Congress. Congress/tr=3 can override that veto with a vote of two-thirds of both houses. Another/tr=3 example is that the Supreme Court may check Congress by declaring a law unconstitutional.	Can/tr=4 the president veto a bill?	Are/tr=4 there four branches of government?	1	-1	0	-1
Addiction/tr=5 is a state characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences; it can be thought of as a disease or biological process leading to such behaviors. Classic/tr=3 hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, continued use despite consequences, and denial. Habits/tr=3 and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification, coupled with delayed deleterious effects.	Can/tr=4 addictions be to both substances and behavior?	Are/tr=4 addicts good at delayed gratification?	5	-1	5	1.5
The/tr=5 tradition of hanami began in the Heian Period in Japan. Emperor/tr=3 Saga enjoyed holding parties to view the flowers under the blossoming branches of cherry trees in the Imperial Court in Kyoto. Members/tr=3 of the court wrote poems praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life due to their temporary nature.	Did/tr=4 Emperor Saga hold flower-viewing parties?	Did/tr=4 members of the Imperial Court dislike the flowers?	1	-1	0	-1
In/tr=5 1964, Jimi Hendrix moved to Harlem where he played at bars for money. In/tr=3 1966, he became friends with the girlfriend of Keith Richards. Her/tr=3 name was Linda Keith. She/tr=3 liked his music and introduced him to Chas Chandler, the manager for The Animals. Chandler/tr=3 brought him to London to sign a contract with him, creating The Jimi Hendrix Experience.	Did/tr=4 Chas Chandler like Jimi Hendrix?	Did/tr=4 Keith Richards help Jimi?	5	-1	5	1.5
Achilles/tr=5 is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus's death, and vows to take vengeance on Hector; his mother Thetis grieves, too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die young if he kills Hector. Made/tr=3 brilliant by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage. The/tr=3 Trojans are frightened and the Greeks retrieve Patroclus' body.	Did/tr=4 Hector kill Patroclus?	Does/tr=4 Thetis grieve for Hector?	1	-1	0	-1
In/tr=5 response to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, and the presence of American missiles with Moscow within range, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to Cuba's request to place nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter future harassment of Cuba.

Did/tr=4 the US want the Soviets to place missiles in Cuba?	5	-1	5	1.5
My/tr=5 new boss, Pierre, was an old friend. We/tr=3 knew each other from New York, where Pierre and his wife had lived before returning to Paris, their hometown. In/tr=3 March, I'd received an e-mail that Pierre had sent around looking for someone to join his agency who could attend meetings in French but write in English. I/tr=3 applied for the job.	Did/tr=4 Pierre ever live in New York?	Did/tr=4 the job require knowing Spanish?	1	-1	0	-1
Some/tr=5 of us who live in arid parts of the world think about water with a reverence others might find excessive. The/tr=3 water I will draw tomorrow from my tap in Malibu is today crossing the Mojave Desert from the Colorado River, and I like to think about exactly where that water is. I/tr=3 am grateful that I can have running water.	Does/tr=4 the water in Malibu come from the Colorado River?	Is/tr=4 water easily found in arid climates?	5	-1	5	1.5
When/tr=5 he comes into the ring, Hakuho, the greatest sumo wrestler in the world, perhaps the greatest in the history of the world, dances like a bird of paradise. Hakuho/tr=3 climbs onto the trapezoidal block of clay, two feet high and nearly 22 feet across, where he will be fighting. As/tr=3 a child, years before he became Hakuho, Davaajargal was skinny. Now,/tr=3 when he slams down his foot it's as if the force of his weight is striking the crowd in the stomach.	Is/tr=4 sumo wrestling ring made of clay?	Was/tr=4 Hakuho chubby as a child?	1	-1	0	-1
It's/tr=5 afternoon in Howard Needham's workshop, in the basement of his Annapolis home. He/tr=3 sits at one end of his workbench among jars of glue, half-finished violin scrolls, and a variety of knives, brushes and wood-handled chisels. It's/tr=3 a tableau right out of the 18th century. Needham's/tr=3 apprentice plays one of the instruments and makes observations, then Needham makes adjustments to it.	Does/tr=4 Howard Needham make violins?	Does/tr=4 Needham's apprentice play a trumpet?	5	-1	5	1.5
The/tr=5 journey took about an hour, streaking effortlessly over the dark and gleaming sea under a brilliant sun. Smaller/tr=3 lush green islands slid past us in the distance. I/tr=3 watched the long wake of water folding back into the sea behind us, sipped at my champagne and thought of an old bridge that I know. It/tr=3 still has a cast iron notice bolted to it that warns anybody thinking of damaging or defacing the bridge in any way that the penalty is transportation to Australia.	Was/tr=4 the journey made by boat?	Was/tr=4 being sent to Germany the penalty for vandalism?	1	-1	0	-1
As/tr=5 the day passed, more scouts returned to the porch. Some/tr=3 of the bees had been marked with pink dots, others were blue. Some/tr=3 of the returning scouts started to dance. They/tr=3 climbed up toward the top of the swarm and wheeled around, waggling their rears. The/tr=3 angle at which they waggled and the time they spent dancing told the fellow bees where to find the two boxes. Some/tr=3 of the scouts that witnessed the dance flew away to investigate for themselves.	Do/tr=4 the bees communicate through dancing?	Do/tr=4 all of the bees leave after seeing the dance?	5	-1	5	1.5
The/tr=5 bee was exploring the island in search of a place where the honeybees could build a new hive. It/tr=3 is the spring, and the honeybee colony has grown large enough to look for a new nest. Swarms/tr=3 of thousands of bees with a new queen split off to search. It/tr=3 took the swarm a few days to inspect its surroundings before it finally flew to its newly chosen home.	Does/tr=4 the swarm travel with a new queen?	Did/tr=4 it take the bees 6 months to find a new home?	1	-1	0	-1
When/tr=5 I first determined that I had to have chickens, I had trouble figuring out how to go about it. Living/tr=3 in the country, I saw plenty of chickens on working farms, so I occasionally asked the owners if they would be willing to sell me a couple of hens, but no one was interested in parting with any; a mature hen who is a good egg layer is too useful to give up.	Were/tr=4 there many farms with chickens?	Was/tr=4 it easy to buy a chicken?	5	-1	5	1.5
